A SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction with Python

There is an ongoing war btw CountryA and CountryB, CountryA is traveling with a Submarine inside the water but unfortunately, CountryB planted Mines for a time of like this
My job as a Data Scientist is to create a system to predict if the object beneath is a Mine or a Rock when the submarine of CountryA sends a Sonar signal.

This is the workflow of how I was able to solve the problem
